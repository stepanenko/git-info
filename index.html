        Maurice Wilder-Neligan (1882–1923) was a British-born Australian soldier who commanded the 10th 
        Battalion during the latter stages of World War I. Emigrating to Australia before the war, he enlisted 
        in the Australian Imperial Force. He was decorated for bravery and commissioned during the Gallipoli 
        Campaign of 1915. He received a severe head wound while leading a successful raid on German trenches 
        near Fleurbaix, France, in early 1916, earning a second decoration for gallantry and the praise of war 
        historians. In July 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and received command of the battalion. 
        He led it during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge in September and was made a Companion of the Order 
        of St Michael and St George in June 1918. He was again decorated for courage for the capture of the 
        commune of Merris on 29 July. After the war, he worked as a district officer in the Territory of 
        New Guinea, where he died at the age of 40, probably of complications from his war wounds.
