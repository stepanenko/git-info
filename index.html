          Maurice Wilder-Neligan (1882–1923) was a British-born Australian soldier who commanded the 10th
          Battalion during the latter stages of World War I. Emigrating to Australia before the war, he enlisted
          in the Australian Imperial Force. He was decorated for bravery and commissioned during the Gallipoli
          Campaign of 1915. He received a severe head wound while leading a successful raid on German trenches
          near Fleurbaix, France, in early 1916, earning a second decoration for gallantry and the praise of war
          historians. In July 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and received command of the battalion.
          He led it during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge in September and was made a Companion of the Order
          of St Michael and St George in June 1918. He was again decorated for courage for the capture of the
          commune of Merris on 29 July. After the war, he worked as a district officer in the Territory of
          New Guinea, where he died at the age of 40, probably of complications from his war wounds.
